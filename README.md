# Zomato-Restaurants-Analysis-using-Excel-Sql-Tableau-and-PowerBI
Data analysis project of the Zomato restaurant This project consisted in analyzing the data from the Zomato restaurant using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, and the creation of interactive dashboards using Power Bi and Tableau. The objectives of the project were:

Build a campaign card table Build a calendar table using the DateKey column and addition of columns such as the year, Mensno, Mensullname, quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), Yearmonth (Yyyy-Mmm), Weekdayno, Weekdayy, Financialmonth (April = FM1, May = FM2 FM12) and financial quarter (Quarters over the month of the city and FM12) and a financial quarter (quarters over the month) Country Analyze the opening trends of restaurants per year, quarter and months to count restaurants by average notes creating buckets for the ranges of average price and by discovering how many restaurants fall into each bucket of the percentage of restaurants and Online delivery options by developing graphics based on kitchens, cities, notes and other relevant parameters to achieve these objectives, the project used by various functions of excellent advances, such as Vlackup, pivottables, and formulation conditions. A SQL request was made to extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset. Using the data obtained, we created an interactive monitoring panel using power-by and tables to provide valuable information on catering industry trends related to location, opening trends, notes and prices.

The project showcases the use of Excel, SQL, and dashboard tools such as Power BI and Tableau for data analysis and visualization, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.

Excel To achieve the objectives of the Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project, various advanced Excel functions were used, including:

SUMIFS and COUNTIFS functions to extract and count data based on specific criteria PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize and analyze data Conditional formatting to highlight key insights in the data Report connections to link multiple PivotTables and charts to a single slicer, allowing for dynamic filtering of the data VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH functions to merge data from different tables DATE and YEAR functions to extract information from date fields

SQL To extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset, SQL queries were executed using the following keywords:

SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order HAVING to filter data based on aggregated values Window functions, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to perform calculations on subsets of data Date functions, such as DATEADD, DATEDIFF, and DATEPART, to extract information from date fields and perform date calculations

Power BI To visualize and analyze the Zomato restaurant data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards. The following characteristics and features were used:

Data modeling using the relationship between tables and calculated column measurements and DAX formulas, and data visualizations for tables, graphics, cards, etc., to display slicers, data filters, and display dynamic filtering of data drilling functions to navigate between different levels of detail in the data.

In addition to the table Power BI, the table is also used in Zomato Restaurant to create interactive dashboards for data analysis projects. The following characteristics and features were used:

Calculate data mixed fields that combine data from various tables to perform dimension and data measurement calculations to organize and analyze data visualizations such as cards, graphics, tables, and more, and display filters and data settings that allow dynamic filtering of data.
